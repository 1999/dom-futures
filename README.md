## DOM Futures
DOM Promises for browsers and node.js. DOM Promises is a quiet new [spec](http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#promises) intriduced by WhatWG. Promises provide a convenient way to get access to the result of an operation. You can use this package either in browser (it acts like a polyfill if your browser is missing support for DOM Promises) or in your node.js code. This feature used to be called futures.

## Installation
